//frowardRef
In React, forwardRef is a method used to pass a ref from a parent component to a child component. This is particularly useful when you need to directly reference a DOM element or a child component's element from a parent component.

Purpose: Enables a parent component to access a child component's DOM node or method directly using a ref.
Usage: It is typically used for creating reusable components like Input, Button, or Modal.
